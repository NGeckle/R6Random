# R6Random
#### Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege operator randomizer that display a random operator (along with their picture and their badge), random gun selection (shows a picture and how much ammo is in a clip/magazine), random equipment selection (shows how much of the equipment they have), and shows their primary gadget (with a picture and ammo count if it comes with ammo). It also has a recruit randomizer. 

##### I recommend this be used for casual. I don't recommend this to be used on ranked unless you are confident you will do well, or if you are with a group who don't care.

It doesn't work on Safari for some reason, but it does work on Chrome. If any one sees this and wants to try it on other browsers for me you are welcome to.
