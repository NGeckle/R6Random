# R6Random
#### Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege operator randomizer that display a random operator (along with their picture and their badge), random gun selection (shows a picture and how much ammo is in a clip/magazine), random equipment selection (shows how much of the equipment they have), and shows their primary gadget (with a picture and ammo count if it comes with ammo). It also has a recruit randomizer. 

##### I recommend this be used for casual. I don't recommend this to be used on ranked unless you are confident you will do well, or if you are with a group who don't care.
